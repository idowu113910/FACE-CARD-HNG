          <h2>My Journey</h2>
          <p data-testid="about-journey">
            My journey into web development started with a curiosity about how
            websites work. From building my first HTML page to mastering modern
            frameworks, every step has been an exciting learning experience. I'm
            passionate about creating web applications that are not only
            functional but also beautiful and accessible to everyone.

          <h2>What I've Learned in This Stage</h2>
          <p data-testid="about-learnings">
            In Stage 1, I've expanded my skills by building multi-page
            applications with client-side routing. I've learned the importance
            of form validation, both for user experience and data integrity.
            Implementing accessible forms with proper ARIA labels and error
            messaging has taught me how crucial it is to build inclusive web
            experiences. The challenge of maintaining semantic HTML while
            creating dynamic, interactive pages has reinforced the fundamentals
            of good web development.

          <h2>My Development Philosophy</h2>
          <p data-testid="about-philosophy">
            I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that prioritizes user
            experience and accessibility. Every project is an opportunity to
            learn something new and push the boundaries of what's possible on
            the web. I'm committed to continuous improvement and staying current
            with web standards and best practices.

        <div class="about-section" data-testid="personal-section">
          <h2>Beyond Code</h2>
          <p data-testid="about-personal">
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies,
            contributing to open-source projects, and sharing knowledge with the
            developer community. I believe that the best developers are those
            who never stop learning and are always willing to help others grow.
